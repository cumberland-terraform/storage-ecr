                app_env                         = "<application-environment>"
                domain                          = "<active-directory-domain>"
                pca                             = "<pca-code>"
                availability_zones              = [ "<availability-zones>" ]
	}

	redshift				= {
        # TODO
	}
}
```

`platform` is a parameter for *all* **MDThink Enterprise Terraform** modules. For more information about the `platform`, in particular the permitted values of the nested fields, see the [mdt-eter-platform documentation](https://source.mdthink.maryland.gov/projects/ET/repos/mdt-eter-platform/browse). The following section goes into more detail regarding the `ecr` variable.

### Parameters

TODO

## Contributing

Checkout master and pull the latest commits,

```bash
git checkout master
git pull
```

Append ``feature/`` to all new branches.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/newthing
```

After committing your changes, push them to your feature branch and then merge them into the `test` branch. 

```bash
git checkout test && git merge feature/newthing
```

Once the changes are in the `test` branch, the Jenkins job containing the unit tests, linting and security scans can be run. Once the tests are passing, tag the latest commit,

```bash
git tag v1.0.1
```

Once the commit has been tagged, a PR can be made from the `test` branch into the `master` branch.
